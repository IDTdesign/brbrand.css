# Color

Updated: March 3, 2018

In the interface, we use color to convey meaning and do not use it to decorate. Color is a tool for managing user's attention: it helps to highlight the main thing, and not to distract from what is important.

Each color in the IDT interfaces solves a specific task:

* _Black, white, and shades of gray_ - working colors for the output and structuring of information on the screen.
* _Semantic colors: links, errors_ - attract attention and help to quickly read information from the screen.
* _Brand color_ - helps the services of the IDT to differ from each other, and the user to understand where he got.

## Black, white, gray

We use a “pure” gray color. It looks neutral and is combined with the rest of the colors in the interface.

### Background

The gray background divides the content into semantic blocks and groups the elements on the page.

For the background, we use three colors:

| Color            | Shade of black | Title                  |
| :--------------- | -------------: | :--------------------- |
| #FFFFFF          |             0% | White                  |
| #F2F2F2          |             5% | Grey                   |
| #E5E5E5          |            10% | Dark grey              |
| rgba(0,0,0,0.05) |             5% | Transparent grey       |
| rgba(0,0,0,0.1)  |            10% | Transparent dark grey  |

### Line

The color of the dividing line #E5E5E5. To make the line contrast and get a background tone on it, use the transparency of 10% black #000.

| Color            | Shade of black | Title                  |
| :--------------- | -------------: | :--------------------- |
| #E5E5E5          |            10% | Dividing line          |
| rgba(0,0,0,0.1)  |            10% | Transparent divider    |

The line is used:

* to separate the semantic parts on the screen;
* to enhance the contrast at the boundary of two backgrounds;
* as a one-pixel shadow.

# Text

As the basic “black” color for text, use #333333 or 80% black.
